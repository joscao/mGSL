# mGSL: modified Generic Scientific Library

The GSL: GNU Scientific Library https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/ has been of mayor influence on the C and C++ writing scientific community.

Sadly the interface of the GSL does not represent modern C++ as described in the C++ Core Guidelines https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines.

The goal of mGSL is not a direct rewrite of the GSL but a realistic assessment which parts are of importance in a post C++20 world.



This is a personal pet project to enhance my own programming skills and create modern, usable C++ code.
